# Mental Health Wellness App   

# Project Overview    

The Mental Health Wellness app is going to be an Android phone app that monitors your phone usage and habits to help you live a better life. The focus of the app is to provide the user with tools to help them live a healthier life by changing what they do in their free time. This app will track your daily sleep count, work out frequency, weight, and work/school hours. You can set goals that you want to accomplish (ex: work out 3x a week) and track them week by week. Additionally it will keep information in regards to social media usage/phone usage to make sure you aren’t wasting excessive time on these mind numbing activities.  

The major goal of this project is to give the user a weekly rating based on how well they did in achieving their goals. A high rating will be scored weekly when the user meets their goals, has a low social media usage, sleeps a healthy amount.. Etc. The purpose of this rating is to inform the user of their habits, so they can take action. This data can be stored locally onto each user’s phone, and then stored in an SQLite database for some online functionality that’s stated in the extra features list.   

Another module that can be added to this project is a friends/family list where you can share your results. If a friend list is added we can make a local leaderboard to compare the list of users results. Additional features for this project would be to create a desktop application that also monitors social media/game usage in order to report on this as well.   


# Vision Statement    

# Persona 1    

# Persona 2    
Persona 1. Older (45-60+)

The user we are targeting is someone who uses their phone and browses social media excessively, and wants to change their habits to live a better life. This falls into many categories of people, but for this persona we will be discussing the use for the older generation.

The background for this user is that they are older, they’ve been very slow to get on social media, but now that they have they are quite addicted and spend most of their free time endlessly browsing on their favorite social media. They understand they have a problem and they would like to change these habits to use their freetime to do activities they used to enjoy, like reading or making time with their family. They aren’t very tech savvy, and get frustrated quickly at a complex graphical interface.

This product meets their need by identifying their problem and quantifying it, letting them work towards their goals week by week. They will be able to see exactly how much time they spend online, and the app will encourage them to pursue a better life. Furthermore the app will be very easy to use, and will not frustrate them when they are learning all the features that are incorporated.
